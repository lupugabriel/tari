## Build Configuration

To configure the build, ```cd``` to the Tari repository and then 
```Shell Script
cd base_layer/wallet_ffi
open build.sample.config
```

Which will present you with the file contents as follows
```text
BUILD_ANDROID=1
BUILD_IOS=1
SQLITE_SOURCE=https://www.sqlite.org/snapshot/sqlite-snapshot-201911192122.tar.gz
NDK_PATH=/Users/user/Desktop/android-ndk-r20
PKG_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/zeromq/4.3.2/lib/pkgconfig
ZMQ_REPO=https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
ANDROID_WALLET_PATH=/Users/user/Desktop/wallet-android
IOS_WALLET_PATH=/Users/user/Desktop/wallet-ios

```
The following changes need to be made to the file
1. ```NDK_PATH``` needs to be changed to the directory of the Android NDK Bundle.
2. ```ANDROID_WALLET``` needs to be changed to the path of the Android-Wallet repository
3. ```IOS_WALLET_PATH``` needs to be changed to the path of the Wallet-iOS repository
4. ```TARI_REPO_PATH``` needs to be changed to the path of the Tari repository
5. ```BUILD_ANDROID``` can be set to ```0``` to disable Android library build

Save the file and rename it to ```build.config```

```

The relevant libraries will then be built and placed in the appropriate directories of the Wallet-iOS and Wallet-Android repositories.
